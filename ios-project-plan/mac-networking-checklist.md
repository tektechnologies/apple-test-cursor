- **Group Policy**: macOS Configuration Profiles replace Windows Group Policy Objects
- **File Permissions**: Macs use POSIX permissions locally but respect NTFS permissions over SMB
- **Remote Management**: No native equivalent to Windows Remote Desktop; requires VNC or third-party tools
- **Registry**: Macs use plist files instead of Windows Registry for configuration storage
- **Updates**: macOS updates the entire OS, unlike Windows component-based updates
- **Antivirus**: Less critical than Windows but still recommended for enterprise environments

This checklist ensures comprehensive integration of Macs into your existing PC-centric network while maintaining security and functionality standards.
